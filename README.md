# logicmoo-project-kb
Project Management for LOGICMOO in SubL/CycL

To run, edit shared-startup.subl to reflect the correct path:

```(csetq *LOGICMOO-KB-DIR* "/var/lib/myfrdcsa/collaborative/git/logicmoo-project-kb")```

Then startup OpenCYC, and once that has started - run:

```(load "<PATH_TO>/shared-startup.subl")```
